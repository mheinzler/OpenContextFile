# OpenContextPath

This Sublime Text package allows you to quickly open files and folders from
anywhere within a text (e.g. a file, the build panel, etc.) by simply using the
context menu or a keyboard shortcut.

For example:

## Installation

### Package Control

The easiest way to install is using Sublime Text's
[Package Control][package-control]:

- Open the `Command Palette` using the menu item `Tools` → `Command Palette…`
- Choose `Package Control: Install Package`
- Install `OpenContextPath`

### Download

- Download a [release][releases]
- Extract the package and rename it to `OpenContextPath`
- Copy the package into your `Packages` directory. You can find this using the
    menu item `Preferences` → `Browse Packages…`.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to open paths:

- Open the context menu on a path and choose "Open *file*"
- Position the cursor within a path and press
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> (macOS:
    <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>)
    - With this it is also possible to open many paths at the same time by using
        multiple selections

This works for both absolute and relative paths. See the "directories"
configuration option to specify which directories to search for relative paths.

## Configuration

To overwrite any of the default settings use the menu item `Preferences` →
`Package Settings` → `OpenContextPath`. There you can also find the default
keyboard bindings and an example for mouse bindings.

It is also possible to use project-specific settings which take precedence over
the global settings. For that, you must add "open_context_path" to the
"settings" key. Your project file should look similar to the following example:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "open_context_path": {
            "directories": [
                "project-specific-directory"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Settings

**directories**

This is a list of directories to search when processing relative paths. If you
want to be able to open files from a text that only includes their names or a
part of their path, add the directory that contains them here.

These directories can also be relative paths. In this case they are relative to
the folder the current project file is located in.

Specifying too many directories here can possibly lead to noticeable delays.

Variables of the form `$varname` and `${varname}` will be expanded. This
includes [Sublime Text variables][st-variables] and environment variables. This
uses the *expand_variables* API so other features like placeholders
(`${varname:placeholder}`) are also supported.

A literal `$` character needs to be escaped as `\\$`.

**patterns**

These regex patterns are used to match line and column numbers in the text
after a path to make it possible to open a file at the specified position. They
must be matched by the named groups *line* and *col* respectively.

For example, the default patterns match the line and column numbers in the text
*path:line:column* with the following regex (the column number is optional):

```
":(?P<line>\\d+)(?::(?P<col>\\d+))?"
```

**context**

This is the number of characters that will be searched in both directions
around the cursor to find a path. Increasing this number makes it possible to
find longer paths but will also significantly increase the amount of time it
takes to find a path.

The default value should be good enough to detect most paths and not produce
any noticeable delays.
